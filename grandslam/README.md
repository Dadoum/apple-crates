# apple-account

A library reimplementing `grandslam` and `itunes` endpoints.

`grandslam` is modeled mostly around concepts from AuthKitWin, 
StoreServicesCore and AppleMediaServices.

`itunes` is modeled after some personal reversing of iTunes, and 
the code of [ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool).
